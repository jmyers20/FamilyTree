# FamilyTree
Programming Assignment #2 written in Python

Execute this program with the following syntax format:
  $> python3 myFamilyTree.py test1.txt output1.txt

I added all the test cases for future use, which can be interchanged into the above line. My plan was to test everything in output1 to save space.
